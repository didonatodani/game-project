#MY GAME - MEMORY

##Description

Classic memory game in which the player has to find the matching cards by clicking on the ones displayed on the board. The cards will be shown at the beginning of the game, for 30 seconds. The aim of the game is to find the pairs before the timer stops at minute 3. The player starts the game with 4 lives.

While playing, after minute 1 and minute 2, the cards that haven't been matched will be swapped randomly again, WITHOUT being shown.

If the player selects cards that do not match, a life will be removed.

The game ends when player finds all matching cards, when loses all the lives by choosing the wrong pairs or when time's out.
